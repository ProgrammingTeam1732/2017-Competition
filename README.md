# 2017-Competition
Repository to house 2017 competition code

Things we will do this year:

  write all our code so that it is neat, east to read, easy to edit, easy to understand, etc.
  
  will write useful commit messages so that others can read them and understand what code changes were made.
  
  will use documentation comments and regular comments to help explain the code.
