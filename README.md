# 2017-Competition
Repository to house 2017 competition code

This year, we will...

- write all our code so that it is neat, east to read, easy to edit, easy to understand, etc.

- write useful commit messages so that others can read them and understand what code changes were made.

- use plenty of documentation comments and regular comments to help explain the code.
