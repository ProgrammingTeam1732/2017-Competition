# 2017-Competition
Repository to house 2017 competition code

This year, we will...

1. write all our code so that it is neat, east to read, easy to edit, easy to understand, etc.

2. write useful commit messages so that others can read them and understand what code changes were made.

3. use plenty of documentation comments and regular comments to help explain the code.
